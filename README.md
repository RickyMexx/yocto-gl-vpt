# Yocto/GL: Volumetric Path Tracing

This project is though and realized as an extension of [Yocto/GL](https://xelatihy.github.io/yocto-gl/), a collection of small C++17 libraries for building physically-based graphics algorithms. All credits of Yocto/GL to [Fabio Pellacini](http://pellacini.di.uniroma1.it/) and his team.

## Introduction
As stated in the project title, we deal with volumetric path tracing ([VPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_path_tracing)) since it's not currently supported by the current release of Yocto/GL. In particular, we focus our implementation on heterogeneous materials, adding full support for volumetric textures and [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/download/) models. Next, we proceed with the implementation of delta tracking algorithm presented in [PBRT](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Light_Transport_II_Volume_Rendering/Sampling_Volume_Scattering.html) book and a modern volumetric method proposed by [TO-DO]().
